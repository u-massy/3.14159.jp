[{"content":"Fiji is an island nation located in Oceania, specifically in Melanesia.\nIts main island\u0026rsquo;s width is comparable to the distance between Nagano and Ina in Japan.\nThe country\u0026rsquo;s capital and largest city is Suva, while Nadi is another major city, home to Nadi International Airport. Fiji Airways, a state-owned airline, operates direct flights between Narita and Nadi.\nThe population of Fiji is primarily composed of native Fijians (54.30%), followed by Indo-Fijians (38.10%), with other ethnic groups making up the remaining 7.60%.\nFijians are known for being very friendly, often greeting visitors with \u0026ldquo;Bula!\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;Hello!\u0026rdquo;.\nMemorable Experiences from My Fiji Trip Why So Many Japanese Cars? One surprising observation was the prevalence of Japanese cars. This is due to several reasons:\nLeft-Hand Traffic: As a former British colony, Fiji drives on the left side of the road. High Import Tax: There\u0026rsquo;s a 100% import tax on new cars in Fiji. Durability and Right-Hand Drive: Fijians value high-quality used cars with right-hand drive, making Japanese imports highly sought after. Among the Japanese cars driven in Fiji, there were some that still had the taxi stickers from their time in Japan. An Interesting Political System Fiji has a unique political structure. It is a Republic where the President serves as the head of state. While the role is largely ceremonial, similar to the Emperor of Japan, the President does hold important reserve powers and is the commander-in-chief of the military.\nThe President is appointed by the Parliament for a three-year term, which can be renewed once, under the 2013 Constitution. This contrasts with some other former British colonies that still maintain the British monarch as their head of state. The office of the president was established after military coups in 1987 led to the proclamation of a republic.\nIncredibly Friendly People! The warmth and hospitality of the Fijian people left a lasting impression. Their welcoming nature truly made the experience special.\nFood Scene In Fiji, you can find familiar international hamburger chains like Burger King and McDonald\u0026rsquo;s.\nHowever, I highly recommend trying the traditional Fijian dish called Kokoda, which is raw fish marinated in coconut milk. You can also find fresh fruit at low prices in places like Nadi Town.\nPassion for Rugby Fiji has a formidable rugby team! Their men\u0026rsquo;s rugby sevens team won gold medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, defeating Great Britain 43-7, and again at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, beating New Zealand 27-12.\nsource: Rugby sevens at the Summer Olympics - Wikipedia This achievement is even commemorated on a special 7 Fiji dollar memorial bill.\nSouth Sea Island: A Must-Visit Just an hour\u0026rsquo;s boat ride from Nadi International Airport is South Sea Island, a beautiful destination known for its stunning waters and delicious food. You can also enjoy traditional Fijian dance performances there.\nWhile on South Sea Island, a staff member selling drinks approached me and asked, \u0026ldquo;Do you drink alcohol?\u0026rdquo; Fijians are very friendly, so they often strike up conversations right away. I replied, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m 18 now, so I don\u0026rsquo;t drink.\u0026rdquo;\nBut he immediately countered, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s legal here!\u0026rdquo;\nUnlike Japan, where the drinking age is 20, in Fiji, it\u0026rsquo;s 18. After a moment\u0026rsquo;s hesitation, I responded, \u0026ldquo;I want my first drink to be in my home country.\u0026rdquo;\nI ended up ordering a Sprite.\nHowever, when I later saw Asahi Super Dry, a popular Japanese beer, on the menu, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but feel a slight regret, thinking, \u0026ldquo;I should have had it.\u0026rdquo;\nFiji is a fun-filled island country in Oceania with a strong rugby team and beautiful resorts, and above all, incredibly friendly people.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/2024_fiji_study_abroad/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFiji is an island nation located in Oceania, specifically in Melanesia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"./Fiji_place.png\" alt=\"Fiji\u0026rsquo;s place\"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts main island\u0026rsquo;s width is comparable to the distance between Nagano and Ina in Japan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"./Fiji_size_Japan.png\" alt=\"Fiji\u0026rsquo;s size\"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe country\u0026rsquo;s capital and largest city is Suva, while Nadi is another major city, home to Nadi International Airport.\nFiji Airways, a state-owned airline, operates direct flights between Narita and Nadi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe population of Fiji is primarily composed of \u003cstrong\u003enative Fijians (54.30%)\u003c/strong\u003e, followed by \u003cstrong\u003eIndo-Fijians (38.10%)\u003c/strong\u003e, with other ethnic groups making up the remaining 7.60%.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Fiji Study Abroad: More Than Just Paradise!"}]
